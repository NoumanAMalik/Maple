## Design Context

### Users
Developers who need a quick, convenient online editor for code-related tasks (not a daily-driver IDE). They open Maple for fast edits, snippet reviews, or small fixes without the overhead of a heavyweight editor. Speed and simplicity matter most.

### Brand Personality
Refined, swift, essential. Calm and focused; professional and confident. The interface should feel quietly capable and distraction-free.

### Aesthetic Direction
Two intentional modes:
- Landing page: warm, editorial, tactile; cream background with terracotta accent; serif typography; subtle grain texture.
- Editor: dark, premium, focused; Bearded Theme Black & Gold; JetBrains Mono for code; gold accents used sparingly.

References: Linear (clean, fast, keyboard-first), Notion (warm, approachable productivity).
Anti-references: generic Bootstrap/template sites, overly playful/gamified UIs, VS Code-level complexity.

### Design Principles
1. Essentialism: every element earns its place.
2. Quiet confidence: restrained accents, strong typography, generous whitespace.
3. Instant utility: fast load, keyboard-first, zero friction to editing.
4. Crafted details: subtle textures, careful typography, premium finishing.
5. Contextual contrast: warm welcome → focused workspace.
